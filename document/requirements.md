# The weather forecast app – ON Android homework assignment

## Overview

The purpose of the assignment is to assess object-oriented analysis and modelling skills, Kotlin coding skills, and Android project structuring. Take your time on the task, but don't get too carried away. If you submit a solution that is in any way incomplete, the parts that you decided to focus on are relevant.

You are free to use any AI tools to assist you with this task - including for UI/UX design, icon creation, layout generation, or even code scaffolding. If you do use any tools, please include a short .md file describing which ones you used and how they helped. The focus of this assignment is on your understanding of product logic and implementation - not whether everything is handcrafted from scratch.

## Requirements

Your task is to create an Android app that displays the weather forecast. The application must contain the following features:
* Displaying the weather forecast for the current day.
* Displaying the weather forecast for the week.
* A city list where users can select a city to view its weather forecast information.

## Tech Stack

The solution is expected to be based on:
* Kotlin
* Coroutines
* Jetpack Compose

## Design

Design decisions are entirely at your discretion.

## Delivery

* The solution needs to be 100% executable
* Provide a link to the GitHub repository where your solution is committed
    * Please make sure it is not private or restricted
* If you do use any tools, please include a short .md file describing which ones you used and how they helped.
